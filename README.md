Welcome to logic, a side project I made as an excuse to play with the content I'm learning in Discrete math.

Currently It's capable of processing and computing propositional expressions with the logical operators: Or, And, Not, and Implies.
Using these 4 it is already possible to make any logical function howwever the plan is to add more in the future.

Plan to add:
- Truth table functionality
- Checking if a set of propositions are valid or lead to any conclusions
- I'll add to this list as I learn more of the subject
